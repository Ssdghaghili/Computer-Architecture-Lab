Computer Architecture Lab, designed Arm processor

The ARM architecture has evolved to a point where it supports implementations across a wide spectrum of
performance points. Over two billion parts have shipped, establishing it as the dominant architecture across
many market segments. The architectural simplicity of ARM processors has traditionally led to very small
implementations, and small implementations allow devices with very low power consumption.
Implementation size, performance, and very low power consumption remain key attributes in the
development of the ARM architecture.
The ARM is a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC), as it incorporates these typical RISC architecture
features:<br>
  • a large uniform register file<br>
  • a load/store architecture, where data-processing operations only operate on register contents, not
directly on memory contents<br>
• simple addressing modes, with all load/store addresses being determined from register contents and
instruction fields only<br>
• uniform and fixed-length instruction fields, to simplify instruction decode.<br>
In addition, the ARM architecture provides:<br>
• control over both the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and shifter in most data-processing instructions
to maximize the use of an ALU and a shifter<br>
• auto-increment and auto-decrement addressing modes to optimize program loops<br>
• Load and Store Multiple instructions to maximize data throughput<br>
• conditional execution of almost all instructions to maximize execution throughput.<br>
These enhancements to a basic RISC architecture allow ARM processors to achieve a good balance of high
performance, small code size, low power consumption, and small silicon area.
